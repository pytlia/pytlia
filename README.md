- 👋 hello and hi everyone, check my hand, i’m @pytlia
- 👀 if you're looking right here and reading this, you can't see exactly me right now.
- 🌱 i have not so much experience in emoji and i'm growing under `people-communication rays`
- 💞️ i hope that if we'll live 2 lifes instead of 1, some of you would spend your entire `first` or `second` life
      to watch this github profile and check all projects in it.
- 📫 and yes, it was funny when i watched comedies as a child and someone ride his car right into someone's mailbox)
